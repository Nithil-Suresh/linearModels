Make a second model where, for the categorical variables, you regress price on a model comprised of one-hot encoded regressors/features alone (you can use `pd.get_dummies()`; be careful of the dummy variable trap); what is the $R^2$ and `RMSE` on the test set? Which model performs better on the test set? Make a third model that combines all the regressors from the previous two; what is the $R^2$ and `RMSE` on the test set? Does the joint model perform better or worse, and by home much?"

        "  - `age`: Patient's age\n",
        "  - `transplant`: `control` for not receiving a transplant and `treatment` for receiving a transplant\n",
        "\n",
        "Since a heart transplant is a dangerous operation and even people who successfully get heart transplants might suffer later complications, we want to look at whether a group of transplant recipients tends to survive longer than a comparison group who does not get the procedure.\n",
        "\n",
        "1. Compute (a) the proportion of people who survive in the control group who do not receive a transplant, and (b) the difference between the proportion of people who survive in the treatment group and the proportion of people who survive in the control group. In a randomized controlled trial, this is called the **average treatment effect**.\n",
        "2. Regress `y` on `transplant` using a linear model with a constant. How does the constant/intercept of the regression and the coefficient on transplant compare to your answers from part 1? Explain the relationship clearly.\n",
        "3. We'd like to include `age` in the regression, since it's reasonable to expect that older patients are less likely to survive an extensive surgery like a heart transplant. Regress `y` on a constant, transplant, and age. How does the intercept change?\n",
        "4. Build a more flexible model that allows for non-linear age effects and interactions between age and treatment. Use a train-test split to validate your model. Estimate your best model, predict the survival probability by age, and plot your results conditional on receiving a transplant and not. Describe what you see.\n",
        "5. Imagine someone suggests using these kinds of models to select who receives organ transplants; perhaps the CDC or NIH starts using a scoring algorithm to decide who is contacted about a potential organ. What are your concerns about how it is built and how it is deployed?"

        "**Q5.** This is a question about linear regression. The outcome is whether a defendant is held pre-trial in the Virginia justice system. We would like to understand how that outcome is predicted by characteristics of the defendant, particularly race. Let's be very careful/clear: We aren't saying anyone *should* be held without bond or asserting that people with different demographic variables *should* be more likely to be held, but instead trying to predict whether people with different characteristics *are empirically more likely* to be held without bond, given the available information. This is the first step we would take in investigating whether a system is fair, or how large the disparities are: Does it treat people with similar observable characteristics similarly, or not? We are going to look at a common question: Are Black defendants treated differently from white or Asian ones? (There are Native American defendants, but there are 11 in total, which is such a small number of observations that is difficult to clearly say anything about how this group is treated relative to the others.)\n",

        "The variables in the data are:\n",
        "\n",

        "  - `is_poor`: Whether the defendant is classified as indigent\n",
        "  - `prior_F`, `prior_M`: The number of prior felony and misdemeanor arrests\n",
        "  - `case_type`: A categorical variable indicating a misdemeanor `M` or felony `F` or infraction `I` or special case `S`\n",
        "  - `age`: Defendant's age\n",
        "  - `bond`, `bond_NA`, `bond_type`: The amount of any bond, whether it is missing, and the type\n",
        "  - `sentence`, `sentence_NA`, `sentence_type`: The length of any sentence, whether it is missing, and the type\n",
        "\n",
        "1. Load the `pretrial_data.csv` data. Notice that there are `nan`s, but the data are relatively clean. Because there are `.nan`s among variables you won't use, you'll want to narrow down your analysis to the relevant variables before dropping or imputing missing values.\n",
        "2. Create a dummy variable indicating that the defendant is Black.\n",
        "3. Regress `held` on `Black`. What is the slope coefficient Interpret the coefficient on the Black dummy variable: How much more likely is a black person to be held without bail? What is the $R^2$ of the model?\n",
        "4. Before doing this question, please think for a few minutes about how to make the process of running the following regressions as efficient as possible, before jumping into writing code. Repeat part 2, for the following specifications, keeping track of the coefficient on the Black dummy variable each time:\n",

        "What happens to the coefficient on the Black dummy variable as you include more regressors/features/controls in the regression? Explain your findings.\n",
        "5. Suppose we don't want to see just `Black` and `sex`, but `Black` interacted with `sex`: Are Black men and Black women treated systemically differently from the rest of the population? Implement this in a regression, and explain your findings.\n",
